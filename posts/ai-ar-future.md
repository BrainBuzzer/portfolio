People from 70s imagined we would have flying cars in the 21st century. But we don't. We have self-driving cars, which is a step in the right direction. But we are still far from flying cars. I think the same thing will happen with AI and AR. We will have some amazing technologies in the next 10 years. Especially when it comes to AR.

## AI

The recent developments in AI including ChatGPT and in general the whole plathora of large companies jumping on the bandwagon has been amazing. 5 years ago, I would not have thought that this field would be such advanced. Especially because the voice assistants that were always touted to us, were not that great. Satya Nadella and even creator of Siri agrees. The voice assitants that we have always wanted are not that distant in the future.

## AR

I am a huge fan of Mark Zuckerberg. Say what you want about the guy, he knows how to put the future succinctly. Recently, while watching his interview with MKBHD made me realise that even more. And I was even more excited to see the launch of Quest Pro.

AR has been a technology years in the works, and it might take another 10 years to get to the point where we can have a fully immersive experience. But I think we are on the right track. And I am excited to see what the future holds.

## What I think the future looks like

When you look at these two fields separately, they seem great. But when you look at them together, you can see the next unstoppable force. Imagine a world where you can have a fully immersive experience with your voice assistant. You can have a fully immersive experience with your friends. You can have a fully immersive experience with your family. These tools together will become your personal best friends. And they won't be just regular best friends, they will also be your own personal assistants that you can have full blown intellectual conversations with.

This in itself gives me goosebumps. This is an exciting time that we are living in, and let's see how this future pans out in the coming years.
